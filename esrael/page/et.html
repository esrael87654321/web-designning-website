    HTML AND XHTML
    1. XHTML :
XHTML stands for Extensible Hypertext Markup Language. 
It can be considered as a part of the XML markup language this is because of XHTML have features of both XML and HTML. 
XHTML is extended from XML and HTML. XHTML can be considered as a better version of HTML.                  
   Advantages of XHTML:
-Strict syntax: XHTML has a stricter syntax compared to HTML5, which means that it is more structured and easier to read.
-Standardization: XHTML follows the syntax rules of XML, which is a standardized markup language. 
This makes it easier to create interoperable web pages that work well with different web browsers and devices.
-Better for parsing: XHTML is easier to parse and process than HTML5, 
which makes it a better choice for developers who want to create web pages that can be easily processed by other software tools.                  

Disadvantages of XHTML:
-More difficult to code: XHTML has a stricter syntax compared to HTML5, which can make it more difficult to code.
-Not backward compatible: XHTML is not backward compatible with older versions of HTML,
 which means that some older web browsers may not be able to display XHTML documents properly.
-Requires more bandwidth: XHTML documents tend to require more bandwidth compared to
 HTML5 documents due to their stricter syntax and increased number of tags.

2. HTML 5: 
HTML is the Hypertext Markup Language which is the most widely used language over the internet. 
HTML is used to create web pages and link them from one to another.
*note HTML is not a programming language, it is a markup language.
We can use different other technologies as like CSS and javascript to give a new look to the pages developed by HTML. 
  
Advantages of HTML5:

*Easier to code: HTML5 has a more relaxed syntax compared to XHTML, which makes it easier to code.
*Backward compatibility: HTML5 is designed to be backward compatible with older versions of HTML,
 which means that it can be used with older web browsers.
*Multimedia support: HTML5 includes support for multimedia elements such as video and audio, 
which makes it easier to create web pages that include multimedia content.

Disadvantages of HTML5:

*Non-standardization: HTML5 is not a standardized markup language,
 which means that different web browsers may interpret it differently.
*Security issues: HTML5 includes new features such as geolocation and offline storage,
 which can create security vulnerabilities if not implemented properly.
*Incompatibility with older web browsers: Some older web browsers may not be able to display HTML5 documents properly,
 which can create compatibility issues for developers.

Conclusion:
 XHTML and HTML5 are two different markup languages used for creating web pages. 
 XHTML is more structured and stricter than HTML5, and requires that all tags be properly closed and in lowercase. 
 HTML5 is more forgiving of errors and allows for self-closing tags.
  XHTML requires a Document Type Declaration, while HTML5 does not.
   XHTML documents are validated using XML parsers, while HTML5 documents are validated using the HTML5 validator. 
   HTML5 is designed to be backward-compatible with older versions of HTML, while XHTML is not.

   Virsion of html
html 1.0
The basic version of HTML has support for basic elements like text controls and images. 
 It does not have rich features like styling and other things thatwere related to how content will be
 rendered in a browser.
The initial version of HTML does not provide support for tables, font support, etc. 
html 2.0
it is a non-proprietary format, openly documented specification and freely implementable.
HTML version 2.0 was developed in 1995 with basic intention of improving HTML version 1.0
html 3.2
It was developed in 1997. After HTML 2.0 was developed, the next version of HTML was 3.2

html 4.01
It was developed in 1999. It extended the support of cascading styling sheets. In version 3.2, CSS were embedded
 in HTML page itself. Therefore, if the website has various web pages to apply to the style of each page, we must
 place CSS on each web page. Hence there was a repetition of the same block of CSS.
To overcome this thing, in version 4.01 concept of an external styling sheet emerged. Under this concept, 
an external CSS file could be developed, and this external styling file could be included in HTML itself. 
HTML 4.01 provided support for further new tags of HTML
html 5
This is the latest version of HTML. For a developer, it could be used in 2014. It came up with lots o
 HTML tags support. HTML5 provided support for new form elements like input element s of different types;
 geolocations support tags, etc
